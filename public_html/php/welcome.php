  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to High Desert Off-Road 4x4 Club. HDOR was established in 2001 and is located in Boise Idaho. Our continuing focus has always been four-wheeling with plenty of outdoor adventure, fun, and recreation for the entire family and friends.

  We have always been a club that promotes safety, resource conservation, and treading lightly to encourage a better understanding of off-roading within our community. With our club made up of a diverse group and with most of them having years of four-wheeling experience, this adds up to a wealth of knowledge and benefits for our new members and to those considering membership. We keep an open mind for new ideas and experiences to help keep our club fresh and exciting. We don&#8217;t have any wheelbase or vehicle limitations, in fact we encourage them all from Full-Size rigs to Jeeps, Trucks, Toyotas, and Full Out Buggies. With these things in mind, we are constantly growing. Enjoy your look around and feel free to join us on one of our Club Runs or Monthly Club Meetings.
